# Zombie UUID Preservation

If you use texture-packs that randomize villager textures, you may have noticed that their appearances change after being zombified or cured. 
This mod fixes that, by ensuring the villager's UUID is preserved after each conversion.

**The fix occurs on the server-side**

Although being developped around villagers, this will also takes effect on some other forms of conversion:
- Piglin and Hoglin zombification
- Skeletons turning into strays
- Husk turning into zombies
- Zombies turning into drowned
